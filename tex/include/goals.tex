\section{Goals}

\subsection{Glob}
It should be easy to test a specific version of MPTCP.

By specific version we mean :

* We should be able to pick a commit
* We should be able to select path manager
* we should be able to express the environment to be tested
	- All of them
	- a subpart
	- just one
	- ...

Results should be easy to access without any modifications.
Results should be reproducible : meaning : even configuration and so one should
be some how saved on the repository.

Example of execution

./mpTest --mpCommit xxx --pm yy --pmCommit yyy --conf all
./mpTest --mpCommit xxx --pm yy --pmCommit yyy --conf 42
